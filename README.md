# DisplayMode

A simple Python application designed to manage display modes, likely for automation or quick switching of display settings.

## Files

- `main.py`: The core Python script that contains the application's logic.
- `hotkeys.json`: Configuration file for defining hotkeys used by the application.
- `icon.png`: The application icon.
- `run.bat`: A batch script to run the `main.py` in the background without opening a new command prompt window.
- `run_debug.bat`: A batch script to run the `main.py` directly, useful for debugging.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## How to Run

To run the application in the background:

```bash
run.bat
```

To run the application directly (for debugging or to see console output):

```bash
run_debug.bat
```
